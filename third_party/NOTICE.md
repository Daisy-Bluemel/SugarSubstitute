## 7-Zip

Native 7-Zip command-line binaries are distributed through the `7zip-bin`
package and bundled for responsive standalone-environment extraction. 7-Zip is
Copyright (C) Igor Pavlov and is distributed under its LGPL, BSD, and unRAR
terms. The `7zip-bin` package wrapper is distributed under the MIT License.

## Crashpad

Crashpad is bundled as SugarSubstitute's native out-of-process crash capture
runtime. Crashpad is Copyright The Crashpad Authors and distributed under the
Apache License 2.0. Its linked mini_chromium, zlib, and getopt components retain
their accompanying BSD, zlib, and public-domain notices.

## mpv

mpv and its libmpv client library are bundled as SugarSubstitute's generated-video
decode and playback runtime. mpv is a fork of mplayer2 and MPlayer and is
distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 or later in
the selected Windows build. The complete upstream copyright inventory and LGPL text
accompany the application. The Windows x64 runtime is a checksum-pinned
Paxton-PKJ build of mpv `v0.41.0`, built without GPL components, Lua, or
JavaScript. Its preparation script records and verifies the archive, every
dynamically linked runtime file, the build configuration, and the builder
revision. The bundle also contains the dynamically linked FFmpeg, libass,
libplacebo, shaderc, FreeType, HarfBuzz, FriBidi, GLib, Graphite2, Brotli, bzip2,
libiconv, libintl, liblzma, PCRE2, libpng, zlib, and MinGW runtime libraries;
their copyright and license obligations remain with their respective projects.

The Linux x64 qualification recipe builds official mpv `v0.41.0` commit
`41f6a645068483470267271e1d09966ca3b9f413` with GPL components enabled and links
to the host's shared FFmpeg, libass, libplacebo and Pulse libraries. Its mpv
license is GPL version 2 or later; the GPL text and upstream copyright inventory
are retained under `third_party/licenses/`. The pinned development package
inventory is `third_party/mpv-linux-build-inputs.json`; these build inputs and
system dependencies are not bundled by the recipe. The recipe targets the
prepared host; compilation and playback must be verified before claiming
qualification. It does not produce a portable Linux release. Runtime dependency
notices and any later redistribution qualification remain separate.
